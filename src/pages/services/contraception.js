            <div class="service-faq-answer">If you have missed a pill, it is best to contact your local pharmacy as you will be directed as to what steps you should take next. However, if you have only missed one pill (within a 48-hour period) the advice given would be to take the pill you missed now. It is important to note that this entirely depends on the type of contraception you are taking.</div>
