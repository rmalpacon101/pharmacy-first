            <div class="faq-question">How to avoid getting impetigo?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Usually, this skin infection occurs in individuals who already have damaged skin. This can be a minor injury such as a cut, scratch, insect bite or other skin condition. Therefore, to protect your skin from impetigo, you must keep your minor injuries clean! For example, wash your skin properly with warm water or get appropriate treatment for your skin condition.</div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">If my impetigo starts to improve, do I need to complete my treatment?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, it's important to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your pharmacist, even if symptoms start to improve. This helps prevent the infection from returning and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What should I do if my impetigo keeps coming back?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">If impetigo keeps recurring, you should speak to your pharmacist or GP as this may indicate an underlying condition that needs to be addressed or you may need a different treatment approach.</div>
