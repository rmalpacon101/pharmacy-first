            <p>Simply, an insect bite is a rash, sting, or mark from an insect. In the UK, the most common types of bites are from creatures like bees, wasps, hornets, mosquitos, ticks, horseflies, midges, mites, and fleas.</p>
            <p>Usually, at-home remedies can ease the symptoms of an insect bite. However, if the bite begins to look/feel worse or infected, you can now see a pharmacist for advanced advice and treatment.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">What does an infected insect bite look like?</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Each bite from an insect will look different. Some will look worse than others, and some can cause serious health implications, so it is important to understand what each insect bite looks like. No matter the insect your bite is from, if the bite starts to swell and feel painful it is likely it has become infected.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bite-types">
            <div class="bite-type-card">
              <div class="bite-type-title">üêù Bees, hornets, and wasps</div>
              <p>A sting from either a bee, hornet or wasp will look like a small mark where the stinger has entered the skin. In some cases, the stinger can get stuck, so it is crucial you never pull it as you could potentially squeeze out the poison instead. Rather, brush the stinger sideways with your fingernail or with a bank card and wash the area with soapy water.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bite-type-card">
              <div class="bite-type-title">ü¶ü Mosquito</div>
              <p>A mosquito bite typically appears as a small spot, causing the skin to raise. In addition, this spot will also become irritably itchy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bite-type-card">
              <div class="bite-type-title">üï∑Ô∏è Tick</div>
              <p>When you are bitten by a tick, the insect will still be attached to your skin. Therefore, you must use fine-tipped tweezers to carefully grab the tick as close to the skin and pull it upwards. Once you have gently removed the tick, dispose of it, and clean the bite with antiseptic or soapy water.</p>
              <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Warning:</strong> If your skin starts to show a rash that looks like a bullseye, it is likely you have caught Lyme disease, which can be caused by a tick bite. For this, visit your local pharmacy for treatment and advice.

            <p>Insect bites can happen to anyone at any given time, however those who spend their time engaging in outdoor activities like camping and hiking are at a higher risk.

            <p>To lower the chance of an infection occurring, it is important to clear your skin first from any insect or stinger and wash yourself with soap and water. However, there are further at-home remedies you can do to lower the risk of an insect bite and to ease your symptoms:</p>

              <li>Take painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen (only if painful)</li>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What will happen if I leave my infected insect bite untreated?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Sometimes this can lead to a serious allergic reaction. If you begin to develop an allergic reaction, we advise you to seek urgent medical help such as ringing 111 or calling for an urgent GP appointment.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Should I try removing stingers or insects from my skin?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">For bee stings, brush the stinger sideways with your fingernail or bank card - never pull it out as this can release more poison. For ticks, use fine-tipped tweezers to grab as close to the skin as possible and pull straight up. Always clean the area afterwards with antiseptic or soapy water.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is it best to keep my insect bite covered up?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It depends on the bite. Generally, keeping the bite clean and dry is most important. If the bite is oozing or bleeding, a loose, clean dressing can help protect it. However, many bites heal better when exposed to air. Your pharmacist can advise on the best approach for your specific situation.</div>
