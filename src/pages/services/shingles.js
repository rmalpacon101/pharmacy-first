            <p>More commonly known as shingles, herpes zoster is an infection triggering a painful rash across the body. In the past, medical advice has been to call 111 or book an urgent appointment with your GP, however with the new Pharmacy First scheme this is no longer necessary.</p>

            <p>Shingles is a red rash that typically appears on one side of the body. As this infection worsens, it is important to recognise what each stage of shingles looks like:</p>

                <p class="cause-description">The first stage of shingles is a tingling or painful sensation to the skin. Yet, sometimes this can start out as a headache or feeling unwell.</p>

                <p class="cause-description">In just a few days, a rash will appear on one side of the body and will often show up in a form of clusters. This is commonly found around the chest, tummy, eye, face, and genitals.</p>

                <p class="cause-description">Then, the rash will then turn into itchy blisters, full of liquid and ready to dry out and scab. This will happen just a few days after.</p>

            <p>Those at risk of developing shingles are only those who have previously experienced chickenpox. The reason for this is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.</p>
            <p>Whilst this infection is not contagious, it is crucial to avoid those who have previously not had, been exposed to, or received the chickenpox vaccine. Additionally, it is best to avoid:</p>

            <p>The shingles vaccine is there to prevent the risk of you attracting this unwelcome infection.</p>
            <p>Through the NHS, there is a list of age groups who are eligible to access the shingles vaccine free of charge. These age groups are:</p>

          </div>

          <div class="vaccine-info">
            <p><strong>Why the vaccine is important:</strong> The reason as to why this vaccine is needed, is to not only avoid shingles itself, but because of the numerous complications it can cause. From muscle weakness to the potential loss of sight, visiting your pharmacy and seeking treatment as soon as you start to feel/experience symptoms, can reduce the chances of these extra problems arising.</p>

          <div class="service-section-content">
            <p>It can take up to four weeks for a shingles rash to disappear. However, in some cases even after the rash has gone away, the skin can still feel painful for a few weeks.</p>
            <p>Because of this, we advise you seek immediate medical attention to prevent long-term complications and ensure a quick recovery.</p>

          <div class="service-faq-item">
            <div class="service-faq-question">Should I go to work or school if I have shingles?</div>
            <div class="service-faq-answer">If your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and therefore cannot be covered, it is best to stay off school and work until it has dried out. Shingles can spread to others when the rash is oozing fluid, so if this happens it is best to cover the rash loosely or with a non-sticky dressing.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="service-faq-item">
            <div class="service-faq-question">If I have shingles, is it too late to have the vaccine?</div>
            <div class="service-faq-answer">The shingles vaccine is primarily used for prevention rather than treatment. If you currently have shingles, the vaccine won't help with your current outbreak, but it may help prevent future episodes. Speak to your pharmacist about when it would be appropriate to have the vaccine after recovery.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="service-faq-item">
            <div class="service-faq-question">What kind of treatment can I receive at the pharmacy for shingles?</div>
            <div class="service-faq-answer">Our pharmacists can provide antiviral medications, pain relief, and topical treatments to help manage symptoms and speed recovery. They can also provide advice on managing the condition and when to seek further medical attention if complications arise.</div>
