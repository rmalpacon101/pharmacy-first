            <div class="faq-answer">When you visit us for this service, the members of our team can advise you on how to take emergency contraception. However, you will need to take one emergency contraceptive pill within three to five days of having sex. But this may be different depending on the type of pill.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Who can take the emergency contraceptive pill?</div>
